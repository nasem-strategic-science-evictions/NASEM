COVID-19 Pandemic</h1>
              <p class="lead">
				While moratoriums have protected large numbers of people from evictions throughout the pandemic, they are not a lasting solution because they do not protect landlords and do not address the underlying causes of the problem. Preventing the massive wave of evictions likely to happen when moratoriums are lifted is a key part of the economic and health recoveries from the pandemic recession. This report recommends robust actions needed to build and sustain housing security in the immediate to near future and ensure a rapid and sustained economic recovery.</p>

				<p class="lead">In the body of this report, the proposed actions are color coded to indicate the various timeframes: near-term, or weeks to a few months (green); short-term, or 3–12 months (yellow); or medium-term, or 12–36 months (blue).</p>
